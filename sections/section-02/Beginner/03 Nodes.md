## Notes

A node in n8n is a building block that performs a specific action or operation. Each node has inputs (data it receives) and outputs (data it produces). Nodes can be connected together to create workflows, where data flows from one node to the next. Think of nodes as puzzle pieces that you connect to automate tasks and process information.

During the video ive followed the basic workflow using my local working n8n server. To test how it works locally installed.

Ive added a Manual trigger and google sheets nodes and i've connected to my Google Auth and used a template sheet to output data from it.
