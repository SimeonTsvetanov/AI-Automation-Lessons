## Execution Logs in n8n Workflows

Execution logs in n8n provide real-time visibility into how your workflows are running, showing each step's status, data flow, and any errors that occur. These logs display the input and output data for each node, making it easy to trace the execution path and identify where issues might arise. When a workflow runs, you can click on any node to see its execution details, including the exact data that was processed and any error messages that were generated. This debugging capability is essential for troubleshooting workflow issues and understanding how data transforms as it moves through your automation pipeline.
