## Notes

We have amended a bit the workflow editing only fields that we will need. And also after filtering the Professional emails we have used the aggregate node in order to extract only emails and company names and then send them as a message to our email. (It was in slack but ive decided to improvise).

Also by the end of the video the presenter showed how to use hooks and request.

The completed workflow created during the video can be found: [if you click here](todo).
