Note:
- **Examples of automation:**
  - Customer fills out a form on your website → automatically sends confirmation email and adds info to your database
  - Receiving an invoice → automatically sorted, processed, and sent for approval
  - New employees join → accounts and access are automatically created based on their role
- **Main benefits:**
  - Saves time and reduces manual work
  - Fewer human errors
  - Consistent results every time
  - People can focus on more important tasks


To start with n8n ive created a free (14days trail) acc and using the basic tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uScURRX-Knc&ab_channel=SimonScrapes%7CAIAutomation
ive created a test workflow

Video process in the beginning is to setup a self hosted server using https://elest.io/ (with my google acc)
  - selected n8n service
  - using Hetzner and all the preselected settings! 
  - i need to stop it when the video is over!!!
  - HOSTED HERE: https://n8n-scrapesai-u50186.vm.elestio.app/home/workflows

During the process of test building app we had to login and use Airtable and create a new database with auth token
