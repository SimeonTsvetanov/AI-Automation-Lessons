New Project for collecting and editing data from emails

* Using Gmail, we have to setup ne Auth2.0 from Google Console
    - Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Gmail
    - Then we create AUTH Client with the OAuth Redirect URL provided by the n8n element!
    P.S. -> DON'T FORGET TO ADD FOR TEST CLIENT YOUR EMAIL (not in video and it won't work without it!!!)
* Creating Set Email Values so we can access only the values needed 
* Using Convert to Markdown (as in the example html -> to mark down)
* Posting Email using our Airtable (we had to create new table for it!)
