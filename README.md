## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Overall Progress':'

- [x] Section 1: [The only video you need to Master N8N + AI agents (For complete beginners)] - Started (section 1 getting started)

## 📝 Learning Methodology

For each section, I will:

1. **Review Materials**: Watch videos, read documents, and understand concepts
2. **Take Notes**: Document key insights and important information
3. **Practice Implementation**: Create practical examples and code
4. **Document Progress**: Update section-specific README files
5. **Seek Clarification**: Ask questions when needed
